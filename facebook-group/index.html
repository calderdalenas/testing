        <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/calderdalenas/">Calderdale NAS Facebook Group</a> is a closed gorup which members of the Calderdale NAS can join. If you are on Facebook, please request to join the group and a member of Calderdale NAS will contact you and ask for your email address to match it with the database of members. **PLEASE CHECK YOUR 'OTHER' MESSAGES FOLDER ON FACEBOOK**. This is where the message from one of our admins will likely end up unless you are already friends with them. Here is a guide to accessing your other messages.</p>
        <p>We ask that all members of the Facebook group abide by the rules which are listed below;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose of this page is to provide a forum so members of Calderdale NAS can support each other, share events/ideas, discuss problems and frustrations and share positive experiences. The direct selling or endorsement of products is not allowed but personal member recommendations of ASD related products, services, links to other projects and positive experiences are welcomed as can be useful to fellow members. However it must be recognised that they are personal recommendations and have not been verified by Calderdale NAS.</li>
            <li>Please ensure we respect each others confidentiality and that of our families and remember that many affected by autism are already socially vulnerable and may be experiencing stress or pressure in their everyday lives. The information contained within this group is not intended for reproduction outside of this membership but it is to be remembered that although this is a closed group we cannot guarantee that it is private.</li>
            <li>Please do not include personal information, names of children, adults or anyone without their prior permission. Schools, services and professionals should not be named. Information should not allow individuals to be indentifiable. This can be considered libellous.</li>
            <li>Messages must not be offensive or insulting, racist, homophobic, contain religious intolerance, obscene or discriminatory in any way.</li>
            <li>Although groups on Facebook need to be monitored or moderated, there is no way of monitoring all its users at all times. Any information on social networks CANNOT be guaranteed to be secure and IS in the public domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do need to make a complaint about what has happened to you or others then a good place to start may be your local Citizenâ€™s Advice Bureau. If you wish to discuss any of the information contained within then please contact one of the group admins - Sarah Contrara, Davina Beck and Karen Nelson.</p>
